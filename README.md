## Background
California State University, Northridge has accessibility programs such as JAWS[1], Screen Magnification[2], VoiceOver[3] and Window-Eyes[4] for the visually impaired. However, the programs that are provided do not help in guiding students around campus. We want the university to be more inclusive and give students with disabilities a sense of independence when they are on campus so that they would not need to rely on a second person to guide them around campus. With that said, our application will help students navigate around campus as safely as possible through the use of our mobile application and its associated hardware, as well as know which building they are closest to with accompanying building information. <br />
The purpose of project Appa is to create a mobile application that would guide visually impaired students around the university campus and provide them with relevant information. This project will have an Arduino microcontroller with an ultrasonic sensor attached near the handle of the cane which will detect objects within close proximity, bluetooth beacons will be placed around campus and relay a message when the user is within the radius and have a mobile app that will retrieve and interpret the informations being sent by the bluetooth beacon and Arduino. The app will be simple and user friendly, and will strive to follow WCAG[5] accessibility standards. <br />
- [1] Job Access With Speech (JAWS): Job Access With Speech is a computer screen reader program for Microsoft Windows that allows blind and visually impaired users to read the screen.
- [2] Screen Magnification: Zoom is full-screen magnifier that can magnify the items on the screen up to 40 times built into Apple Inc.'s Mac OS X, iOS and iPod operating systems.
- [3] VoiceOVer: A screen reader built into Apple Inc.'s Mac OS X, iOS and iPod operating systems.
Window-Eyes: Window-Eyes is a screen reader for Microsoft Windows.
- [4] Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG):  a set of guidelines developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) with the goal of making web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Though these guidelines were developed for web content, these guidelines are also highly relevant to mobile content and will serve as a baseline for developing an accessible mobile application.
